# Coding for the Earth: Intro to Climate Data Visualizations Using Python
Developed by Computing Fellows Chianna and Bryn for the Climate & History course at Barnard College. Adapted by postbacc fellow ZoÃ« Webb-Mack.

### Workshop description:
An introductory data visualization workshop using Python, Pandas, and Altair, which uses a global climate dataset as example data. Includes some discussing of climate data. During the workshop, students will work in Python, using data visualization library Altair and data analysis library Pandas, to create basic data visualizations of a global climate dataset.  We introduce basics of Python, Altair, and Pandas.  We also cover styling in Altair and discuss how styling impacts our interpretation of data.

### Workshop flow:
- Warming up with basics of Python: types (strings and numerical), functions, and dictionaries
- Basics of Altair and Pandas working with a simple dictionary dataset: intro to Pandas dataframes; creating a simple chart from a dataframe using Altair; manipulating color
- Working with global climate dataset: manipulating data using Pandas; generating charts using Altair; Altair's "encode"
- Building skills: conditional color-coding; adjusting titles and style; remaining questions

### In this repository:
- Coding for the Earth Template (Student Template): A workbook for students.  At the beginning of the workshop, students should make a copy so that they can work directly on their version of this file during the workshop.  Contains some text to guide the flow of the workshop and comments to structure code cells, but minimal pre-written code.
- Coding for the Earth Key (Instructor Key): Identical to the student template, but code cells are complete.  Serves as a key or "script" for instructors to reference (as a print-out or on another screen) while leading the workshop.
